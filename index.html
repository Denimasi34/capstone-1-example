        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I am currently learning full-stack web development program by Dr. Angela Yu. Before this, I used to work in shoe industry
            for about 7 years. I know that the program now I am taking is so extremely different from my previous field, but I cannot help myself from
            wanting to get engaged in the IT world which is my passion. So now, I am starting to try to pursue what has become my desire since I was 
            still so young. I believe there is no such thing as "too late" as long as I still have the strength and determination to push myself forward.
